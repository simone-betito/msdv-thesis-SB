Museums are bastions of culture, they hold artifacts from all over the world. These artifacts hold different meanings to different people and some want their artifacts repatriated. Repatriation is defined as: “the restoration of something to its rightful owner.” This visualization proposes a framework for the determination of the suitability of repatriation of an artifact or art piece. It also maps repatriation cases worldwide and applies the framework to a sample of the collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

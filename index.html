                <h3>About Repatriation &amp; Why It's Important</h3>
                <p>
                  Restitution is defined by Merriam Webster as <u>“the restoration
                  of something to its rightful owner.” </u> Many authors have
                  explored the impacts restitution has had on art, museums,
                  culture and the party making the return request. However,
                  universal models seem to be lacking. This project proposes a
                  model for the determination of an item's eligibility for the
                  return to the original owner, through data visualization
                  giving a voice to the marginalized in the process. The
                  marginalized described in this paper are communities who have
                  historically been colonized or without power in the
                  restitution discussions.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Firstly, it will explore the history of repatriation, some of
                  the key contested pieces and some of the positives and
                  negatives of the most popular restitution frameworks: The
                  United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural
                  Organization (UNESCO)’s Illicit Property and Trafficking Act &
                  the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act
                  (NAGPRA). The framework is the main portion of the paper and
                  proposes four pillars: Symbolism, Legality, Morality, and
                  Preservation. This model will be applied to the MET’s
                  collection through their API, as proof of reproducibility.
                  Then the visualization will explore other potential use cases.
                </p>

                  Note: Restitution and repatriation will be used
                  interchangeably throughout this visualization.

                  The repatriation model likely picked up on this item because
                  it meets the Preservation KPI's material assessment as a stone
                  sculpture and the geographical location of where this item was
                  made, Canada. The Inuit were historically marginalized so this
                  meets the Legality KPI. <br />
                  The provenance of this item is not entirely clear. On the
                  MET's website it says: "Said to be from: Port Harrison
                  (Inukjuak) James A. Houston, New York, until 1969". <br />

                      The repatriation model considered this item to be contentious. Likely because it's an item from an Tlingit indigenous people and for this symbolic meaning. The description on the MET's site describes this item as: "This malevolent mask manifests a powerful spirit being that helped a shaman mediate between the worlds of matter and spirit".

                      The model picked up on a few American items, which makes sense considering how the metrics were combined. Items in North America scored higher. Not everything is required to be repatriated if the item makes sense in its current location.

              <h4>How the Symbolism metric is calculated:</h4>
              <p>
                For this model, the Symbolism metric was calculated by binary scoring
                any object name within the "Object Column" of the dataset that had
                any reference to funerary, marriage, armour/war or ceremonial meaning.

              <h4>How the Legality metric is calculated:</h4>
              <p>
                The legality metric was calculated by scoring any item within the "Culture" column in the sample that had a
                culture identified as "peoples" or a historically marginalized
                community as 1 while the rest of the items were scored as 0.

              <h4>How the Preservation metric is calculated:</h4>
              <p>
                The preservation metric is a combination of two parts, the
                materiality score and the risk assessment score. The materiality
                portion was calculated by assessing the strength of the material
                of the artifact. Materiality scale: Clay =
                1 Wood = 2 Ivory & Bone = 3 Stone = 4 Metals = 5. The stronger
                the material, the easier the artifact would be to return without
                damage from transport or the elements.
                <br />
                The risk assessment score was calculated from the official Peace
                Index Scale, honing in on their regional scale from most safe region to
                unsafest region. Regional scoring: Europe = 1 North America = 2
                Asia-Pacific = 3 South America = 4 Central America & caribbean =
                5 Sub-Saharan Africa = 6 Russia & Eurasia = 7 South Asia = 8
                Middle East & North Africa = 9 <br />
                The safer the region, the less risk of damage to the artifact.

              <h4>How the Morality metric is calculated:</h4>
              <p>
                Morality refers to the opinion of the general public on the item
                in question by looking at Google Searches over a period of time.
                This way we can assess if an item is top of mind for the region
                and part of the overall public's discussions. If the Google
                search shows a higher search rate (>1000), then the item is
                given a score of 1, if not, it is scored as 0. However, in this
                particular model, the Morality metric was not applied. This metric can always be applied if deemed appropriate for the situation to provide further context.
